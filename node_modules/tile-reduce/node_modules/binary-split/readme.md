# binary-split

Split streams of binary data. Similar to [split](http://npmjs.org/split) but for Buffers. Whereas split is String specific, this library never converts binary data into non-binary data.

## how fast is it?

on a SSD w/ a Haswell i5 1.3ghz CPU and 4GB RAM reading a 2.6GB, 5.2 million entry line delimited JSON file takes 15 seconds. using `split` for the same benchmark takes 1m23s.

## usage

```
var split = require('binary-split')
```

#### split(splitOn)

Returns a stream. You can `.pipe` other streams to it or `.write` them yourself (if you `.write` don't forget to `.end`)

The stream will emit a stream of binary objects representing the split data.

Pass in the optional `splitOn` argument to specify where to split the data. The default is your current operating systems EOL sequence (via `require('os').EOL`).

For more examples of usage see `test.js`
